# Blockchain-Experiment-2
How might we help people capture and preserve data on new volunteer deeds that doesnâ€™t already exist?

A possible first approach:

Create a separate, 'self-declared' registry of deeds and hours as a distributed, blockchain enabled web app per the mockup and agreed schema, As validated against an inventory of functionality on similar sites like threethingscalgary.ca. Launch initially via ethereum test network and optimize if possible prior to deploying on the main network. Again, 'host' the web app files and static assets via IPFS/Swarm

The first version of this CivicTechYYC blockchain experiment is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ethershare/EtherShare">EtherShare</a> project.
